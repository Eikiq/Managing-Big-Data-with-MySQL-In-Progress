Q2:
How many distinct skus have the brand “Polo fas”, and are either size “XXL” or “black” in color?
GROUP BY 后要加全部的non aggregated field, for teredata
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku) 
FROM skuinfo 
WHERE brand = 'polo fas' AND (color = 'black' OR size = 'XXL');


Q3:There was one store in the database which had only 11 days in one of its months 
(in other words, that store/month/year combination only contained 11 days of transaction data).  In what city and state was this store located?

SELECT DISTINCT t.store, s.city, s.state 
FROM trnsact t JOIN strinfo s 
   ON t.store=s.store 
WHERE t.store IN (SELECT days_in_month.store 
                  FROM(SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate) AS sales_year,  EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS sales_month, store, COUNT (DISTINCT saledate) as numdays 
 FROM trnsact 
 GROUP BY sales_year, sales_month, store 
 HAVING numdays=11) as days_in_month);

Question 4
Which sku number had the greatest increase in total sales revenue from November to December?
There are several possible queries that would arrive at the right answer, one of which is: 

SELECT sku, 
 sum(case when extract(month from saledate)=11 then amt
 end) as November, 
 sum(case when extract(month from saledate)=12 then amt 
 end) as December, 
 December-November AS sales_bump 
FROM trnsact 
WHERE stype='P' 
GROUP BY sku 
ORDER BY sales_bump DESC;

Question 5
What vendor has the greatest number of distinct skus in the transaction table that do not exist in the skstinfo table?  
(Remember that vendors are listed as distinct numbers in our data set).
 SELECT count(DISTINCT t.sku) as num_skus, si.vendor 
FROM trnsact t 
LEFT JOIN skstinfo s 
 ON t.sku=s.sku AND t.store=s.store 
JOIN skuinfo si
 ON t.sku=si.sku 
WHERE s.sku IS NULL 
GROUP BY si.vendor 
ORDER BY num_skus DESC;

Q6What is the brand of the sku with the greatest standard deviation in sprice?  Only examine skus which have been part of over 100 transactions.
SELECT DISTINCT top10skus.sku, top10skus.sprice_stdev, top10skus.num_transactions, si.style, si.color, si.size, si.packsize, si.vendor, si.brand 
FROM (SELECT TOP 1 sku, STDDEV_POP(sprice) AS sprice_stdev, count(sprice) AS num_transactions 
      FROM trnsact
      WHERE stype='P' 
      GROUP BY sku 
      HAVING num_transactions > 100 
      ORDER BY sprice_stdev DESC) AS top10skus 
JOIN skuinfo si 
 ON top10skus.sku = si.sku 
ORDER BY top10skus.sprice_stdev DESC; 

Or without a subquery, such as this: 

SELECT TOP 1 t.sku, STDDEV_POP(t.sprice) AS sprice_stdev, count(t.sprice) AS num_transactions, si.style, si.color, si.size, si.packsize, si.vendor, si.brand 
FROM trnsact t JOIN skuinfo si 
ON t.sku = si.sku 
WHERE stype='P' 
GROUP BY t.sku, si.style, si.color, si.size, si.packsize, si.vendor, si.brand 
HAVING num_transactions > 100 
ORDER BY sprice_stdev DES;

Q13:
Identify which department, in which city and state of what store, had the greatest DECREASE in the number of items sold from August to September.  
How many fewer items did that department sell in September compared to August?
SELECT s.city, s.state, d.deptdesc, t.store,
CASE when extract(year from t.saledate) = 2005 AND extract(month from t.saledate) = 8 then 'exclude'
END as exclude_flag,
SUM(case WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) = 8 then t.quantity END) as August,
SUM(case WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) = 9 then t.quantity END) as September, August-September AS dip
FROM trnsact t JOIN strinfo s
ON t.store=s.store JOIN skuinfo si
ON t.sku=si.sku JOIN deptinfo d
ON si.dept=d.dept
WHERE t.stype='P' AND exclude_flag IS NULL AND
t.store||EXTRACT(YEAR from t.saledate)||EXTRACT(MONTH from t.saledate) IN 
(SELECT store||EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)||EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY store, EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate), EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT saledate)>= 20)
GROUP BY s.city, s.state, d.deptdesc, t.store, exclude_flag
ORDER BY dip DESC;
#The Clinique department in Louisville, KY sold 13,491 fewer items
