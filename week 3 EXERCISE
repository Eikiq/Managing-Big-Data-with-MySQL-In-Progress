SELECT sku, retail, cost, COUNT(sku)
FROM skstinfo
GROUP BY sku, retail, cost

…or retail and cost need to be aggregated to match the sku aggegration:

SELECT sku, COUNT(sku), AVG(retail), AVG(cost)
FROM skstinfo
GROUP BY sku 

The “Selected non-aggregate values must be part of the associated group” error is one of the most common
errors new SQL learners make, so keep an eye out for it. If you see it, immediately check the columns you have
included in your SELECT and GROUP BY clauses
